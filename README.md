<h1 align="center" font-size=10px>Hi! My name is Marina, I have 26 years old and I'm a brazilian girl!</h1>
<p align="center"> 
This year I started my front-end journey, which I am loving and studying very hard to start to work on soon! I'm in career transition, I have a degree in Architecture, and with this I learned how to improve my soft skills, like work in group, team manager and clients, which have a greate value to a software engineer.
